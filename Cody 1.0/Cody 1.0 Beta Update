🚀 Cody 1.0 Beta Deployment & FractiChain Roadmap

Overview

Cody 1.0 is officially entering Beta Deployment with a fully integrated FractiChain infrastructure, ensuring a self-hosted, decentralized AI intelligence system. By moving directly to Phase 3, we eliminate reliance on third-party hosting providers and ensure native integration of FractiTreasury, FractiTokens, and AI-driven fractal intelligence operations.

✅ Deployment Status & Progress

Cody 1.0 Beta

✅ Core AI Engine Deployed – Fully operational with continuous self-learning.
