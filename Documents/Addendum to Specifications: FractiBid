Addendum to FractiAI Specifications : FractiBid Task Allocation System
Overview
FractiBid introduces a dynamic, adaptive framework for task allocation within the FractiAI ecosystem. Leveraging UnipixelAgents’ capabilities, FractiBid combines specialization queues, performance-based matching, and a bidding mechanism for high-priority tasks. This system optimizes resource utilization, enhances task performance, and aligns seamlessly with FractiAI’s fractal principles of self-organization and scalability.
Core Design of FractiBid
1. Task Categorization and Queues
Tasks are categorized into distinct specialization queues based on their type and complexity:
	•	Category Assignment: Tasks are classified (e.g., Pattern Recognition, Optimization, Cross-Domain Integration) with metadata:
	•	Priority: Critical, High, Medium, Low
	•	Complexity: Simple, Moderate, Complex
	•	Estimated Effort: Time and resource requirements
	•	Queue Assignment: Categorized tasks are routed to matching queues, ensuring alignment with agent specialties.
2. Agent Specialization
UnipixelAgents are assigned one or more specialties based on their core capabilities, such as:
	•	Pattern Analysis: Detecting and analyzing fractal patterns.
	•	Optimization: Allocating resources and balancing computational loads.
	•	Adaptation: Responding to environmental changes and scaling tasks.
Agents continuously refine their specialization profiles through performance tracking and adaptive learning.
3. Priority Task Bidding
High-priority tasks activate the bidding mechanism, enabling agents to dynamically propose their suitability:
	•	Bidding Criteria:
	•	Availability: Current workload and resource capacity.
	•	Profile Score: Performance metrics including accuracy, efficiency, timeliness, and reliability.
	•	Estimated Completion Time: Time required to complete the task.
	•	Bid Scoring Formula:
The highest-scoring agent wins the bid.
Key Modules
Task Dispatcher
	•	Purpose: Oversees task posting, bidding, and allocation.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Routing tasks to appropriate queues.
	•	Monitoring queue health and balance.
	•	Assigning tasks to agents via direct matching or bidding.
	•	Library: dispatcher.lib
Specialization Queue Manager
	•	Purpose: Maintains and manages task queues.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Organizing tasks by specialization.
	•	Ensuring fair task distribution.
	•	Monitoring queue performance.
	•	Library: queue_manager.lib
Bid Evaluation Engine
	•	Purpose: Evaluates and ranks bids for high-priority tasks.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Calculating bid scores.
	•	Selecting the most suitable agent.
	•	Managing task reassignment in case of failures.
	•	Library: bid_eval.lib
Agent Performance Tracker
	•	Purpose: Tracks and updates agent performance profiles.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Recording task outcomes.
	•	Updating metrics (e.g., accuracy, efficiency, timeliness).
	•	Enhancing agent matching for future tasks.
	•	Library: performance_tracker.lib
Performance Scoring and Profiling
Performance Metrics
	1.	Accuracy: Precision in task completion.
	2.	Efficiency: Resource consumption relative to task complexity.
	3.	Timeliness: Adherence to deadlines.
	4.	Reliability: Success rate in completing tasks.
	5.	Complexity Handling: Proficiency in managing high-complexity tasks.
Profile Score Formula
Workflow
1. Task Submission
	•	A task is submitted with metadata (e.g., category, priority, complexity, estimated effort).
	•	Tasks are routed to their respective specialization queues.
2. Agent Selection
	•	For non-priority tasks:
	•	The Dispatcher assigns the next available agent from the relevant queue.
	•	For priority tasks:
	•	Agents submit bids via the Bid Evaluation Engine.
	•	The highest-scoring agent is selected.
3. Task Execution
	•	The assigned agent completes the task and submits results to the Dispatcher.
	•	Outcomes are analyzed to update agent profiles.
4. System Learning
	•	The system evaluates task outcomes to improve queue management, bidding strategies, and agent profiling.
Example Scenario
Task
A Critical Pattern Analysis task with metadata:
	•	Priority: Critical
	•	Complexity: High
	•	Estimated Effort: 20 processing units
Bidding Process
	•	Agent A: Profile Score = 85, Estimated Time = 10 minutes
	•	Agent B: Profile Score = 90, Estimated Time = 12 minutes
	•	Bid Scores:
	•	Agent A:
	•	Agent B:
	•	Result: Agent B is assigned the task.
Benefits of FractiBid
	1.	Optimized Task Allocation:
Ensures tasks are matched to the most capable agents.
	2.	Scalability:
