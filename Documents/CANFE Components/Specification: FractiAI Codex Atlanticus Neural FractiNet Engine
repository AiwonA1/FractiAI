Specification: FractiAI Codex Atlanticus Neural FractiNet Engine
Overview
FractiAI represents a revolutionary leap in artificial intelligence, harmonizing recursive fractal principles with dynamic, self-aware computational frameworks. Integrating the SAUUHUPP Master Fractal Template and FractiCatalysts, the Codex Atlanticus Neural FractiNet Engine (Codex Atlanticus) achieves unparalleled scalability, multidimensional adaptability, and systemic harmony. Every element, from Unipixels to complex FractiNet architectures, operates within a fractalized framework that reflects the universal principles of harmony and adaptability.
This document details the design and functionality of Codex Atlanticus, including its architectural components, operational principles, and advanced subsystems such as FractiBid, FractiFinder, FractiBridge, FractiScope, FractiFormer, and FractiEncoder. These components collectively redefine cognitive and computational systems.
