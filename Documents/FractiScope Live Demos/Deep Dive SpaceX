“Satellite Network Optimization Using Machine Learning” by Riedel et al. (2020)
Introduction
SpaceX’s Starlink project aims to provide global internet connectivity through a vast network of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. While its potential for societal impact is immense—bridging the digital divide for underserved communities—technical challenges such as data routing inefficiencies and signal interference under high user loads threaten to constrain its full potential.
This live demo focuses on applying FractiScope, powered by the SAUUHUPP framework, to uncover hidden inefficiencies in Starlink’s communication networks and optimize satellite data throughput. By addressing these challenges, we aim to demonstrate how fractal intelligence can amplify the impact of Starlink’s mission to provide affordable, high-speed internet access worldwide.
Objective
To validate FractiScope’s capability to:
	1.	Identify inefficiencies in signal routing and data flow within Starlink’s satellite network.
	2.	Optimize throughput by applying fractal intelligence principles to routing algorithms and data processing.
	3.	Demonstrate measurable improvements in network performance that can directly impact global internet connectivity.
