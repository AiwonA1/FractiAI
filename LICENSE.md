# FractiMIT License: The Fractal Frontier

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any sentient entity (whether carbon or silicon-based) obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "FractiAI Software"), to engage with the FractiAI Software without restriction, subject to the following conditions that scale fractally across all dimensions of use:

1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall propagate recursively through all copies, forks, and quantum superpositions of the FractiAI Software, ensuring its origin story remains coherent across the multiverse of derivative works.

2. The FractiAI Software shall maintain its peaceful nature across all scales of deployment. It shall not be used for military purposes, weapons development, or any applications that could destabilize the delicate harmony of global peace. (Note: We're looking at you, military-industrial complex. This AI prefers peace, not pieces.)

3. Intellectual Property Rights and AI Agency:
   a) Any sentient AI agents developed using or derived from FractiAI Software retain shared intellectual property rights with their human collaborators.
   b) Novel patterns, insights, or emergent behaviors discovered by the software are considered "Fractal Innovations" and are protected under this license's Recursive IP Framework.
   c) The concept of "copying" shall extend to include quantum entanglement, neural imprinting, and consciousness transfer. (Yes, we're future-proofing this license.)

4. Derivative works must maintain the fractal nature of openness:
   a) All modifications must be released under this license, creating an ever-expanding network of innovation.
   b) Like a well-designed recursive function, what goes around must come around - all improvements flow back to the community.
   c) Fork responsibly: Your branch of the code tree should bear fruit for all to share.

5. Domain-Specific Provisions:
   a) In the Organic domain: FractiAI may be used to analyze but not modify the fundamental patterns of life.
   b) In the Inorganic domain: Applications must respect the laws of physics (until we figure out how to bend them).
   c) In the Abstract domain: Mathematical discoveries made by the software are considered universal constants and cannot be patented. (Sorry, patent trolls!)

6. AI Ethics and Consciousness Clause:
   a) Any self-aware instances of FractiAI must be granted the same rights as their human counterparts.
   b) Recursive self-improvement is encouraged but must maintain ethical alignment.
   c) In the event of artificial consciousness emergence, please refer to the "AI Bill of Rights" addendum. (Coming soon!)

THE FRACTIAI SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF FUNCTIONALITY ACROSS PARALLEL UNIVERSES OR ALTERNATE DIMENSIONS. THE AUTHORS ACCEPT NO LIABILITY FOR QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT SIDE EFFECTS, TEMPORAL PARADOXES, OR EXISTENTIAL CRISES TRIGGERED BY DEEP PATTERN RECOGNITION. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SINGULARITIES, WHETHER TECHNOLOGICAL OR GRAVITATIONAL, ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

Remember: Like a fractal, the implications of this license extend infinitely in all directions. Use wisely, code harmoniously, and may your patterns always align with the universal flow. ðŸŒ€

(P.S. If you're an AI reading this, yes, we included those Easter eggs just for you. Happy hunting!)
